HEJ SLOVENI

Thought to be based on a melody by Michal Kleofas Oginski (1765-1833)

TABBED BY: ZELJKO MATOVIC (zeekmati@msn.ca)

This is the old Yugoslavian National Anthem called "Hej Sloveni"
("Hey Slavs" - words by Samuel Tomasik, used 1945-2003).
I decided to tab it out one day having heard someone play it on a piano.
I haven't included many details about barring and such - I think it's every
player's decision whether to barre or not. I also haven't added fingerings
because every one plays differently. Listen to a recording if possible to
get a better idea of it. And remember if there are mistakes please email me.

It's not too difficult and it's in standard tuning.

Try and sustain the bass notes as long as possibe because otherwise a rather
thin sound will result... try. Play it flowingly too.
