Notes
-----

from the Preface to the Tecla Edition (Brian Jeffrey, 2006)
http://www.tecla.com/extras/2001/2536/preface.htm

"Mauro Giuliani (1781-1829) was one of the most brilliant guitarists of his
time and a fine composer for the instrument. He lived in Vienna in the time of
Schubert and Beethoven, as well as in Italy. These 24 Exercises for the guitar,
Op 48, are among the best known of his works and a fine collection. They come
from that tremendous period in Giuliani's life when he had just arrived in
Vienna. They are brilliant in every way: every piece is intensely musical, uses
the resources of the instrument fully, and every note counts, nothing is wasted.
Like Carcassi's 25 Etudes op. 60, the collection can be seen as a whole, because
it uses contrasting keys from piece to piece and because it builds up to a grand
climax at the end of the last piece. But it is perfectly acceptable to play the
pieces as individual items. The Esercizio was first published in Vienna in
mid-1813, under the title of 'Esercizio per la chitarra, contenente 24 pezzi
della maggiore difficoltà, diversi preludi, passaggi, ed assolo' (Exercise for
the guitar, containing 24 pieces of the greatest difficulty, including various
preludes, passaggi, and solo pieces). It is extremely interesting that the
original title-page says that the pieces are not merely exercises as solo
pieces, but that they include 'preludi, passaggi...', that is to say, music
which can be played as a prelude to something else, or as a 'passage' from one
item to another. Passaggio is a technical term which is practically
untranslatable, meaning a piece which shows some conspicuous or brilliant
feature, modulation, or ornamentation or decoration. The original edition gives
quite a lot of position indications and some open strings, but no other
fingering. Usually in this music a dot on a note does not mean staccato, but
rather not slurred. It usually appears on a note which immediately precedes or
follows a group of slurred notes and distinguishes it from them, to indicate
that it is to be plucked separately and not slurred. Sometimes the dot becomes
a wedge, but whereas in some piano music of the time there is indeed a
distinction between dot and wedge, in the case of this music of Giuliani there
appears to be no difference in sense: rather, it seems that it was just a vagary
of engravers' practice."
